# Using `wskdeploy` for exporting `OpenWhisk` assets

`wskdeploy export` can be used to export `OpenWhisk` assets previously deployed as a *managed project* via `wskdeploy sync -m manifest.yaml`. `wskdeploy export` will create a manifest for the managed project assets and separate manifests for each managed project that this managed project depends upon, if such dependencies exist and have been described in `manifest.yml` when the managed project has been initially deployed.
The manifest(s) resulting from executing `wskdeploy export` can be later used for deploying at a different `OpenWhisk` instance. The code of actions, which are defined in the packages of the exported project will be saved into folders with the names being the names of the package, the actions belong to.

## Use Cases

### Copy `OpenWhisk` Assets

One common scenario, in which the export feature is useful, is populating a newly installed `OpenWhisk` instance with assets from
another `OpenWhisk` instance. One might consider a scenario, in which an `OpenWhisk` instance is installed on premises with another `OpenWhisk` instance residing in the cloud. Consider, for example using one `OpenWhisk` instance on premises and another one in the cloud (e.g., the second `OpenWhisk` instance can be [IBM Cloud Functions](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/)). A fairly common scenario is that a developer
will need to deploy assets from the cloud `OpenWhisk` instance on the on premises one and vice-versa.

### `OpenWhisk` at the Edge

In a variety of IoT and other edge computing scenarios, such as running Virtual Network Functions (VNF) as `OpenWhisk` actions in "edge Data Centers"
embedded with 5G-MEDIA infrastructure (as pioneered in [5G-MEDIA EU H2020 project](http://www.5gmedia.eu/)), there is a need to distribute `OpenWhisk` assets developed centrally in the cloud (e.g., [IBM Cloud Functions](https://console.bluemix.net/openwhisk/)) to multiple `OpenWhisk` instances running at the edge Data Centers. Again, `wskdeploy export` is handy as a basic tool that allows to automate this management task.

## Basic Usage by Example

Consider a simple manifest file [manifest_lib1.yml](../tests/src/integration/export/manifest_lib1.yaml) for a sample project `lib1`.
The project contains a single `lib1_package` package that comprise three actions (the code of the action in this simple example is the
same for all three, but the action names are different).


### Step 1: deploy `lib1` as a managed project

```sh
$ ./wskdeploy sync -m manifest_lib1.yaml
```

### Step 2: validate `lib1` deployment

```sh
$ ./wsk package get lib1_package
```

### Step 3: Export the newly deployed `lib1` project

Exporting `lib1` project into the current directory. Please note that the manifest name should be explicitly specified.

```sh
$ ./wskdeploy export --projectname lib1 -m my_new_lib1_manifest.yaml
```

One can also export a project into a different directory, by specifying a manifest name containing this directory. The directory does not have to exist. `wskdeploy` will automatically create it, if needed.

```

### Step 4: Inspect the newly exported manifest (`my_new_lib1_manifest.yaml`)

<details><summary>(<b>clickable</b>) You should see an output similar to this:</summary>

```yaml
project:
  name: lib1
  namespace: ""
  credential: ""
  apiHost: ""
  apigwAccessToken: ""

        code: ""
        runtime: nodejs:default
        namespace: your_namespace/lib1_package

        outputs: {}
        annotations:

          web-export: ""

    triggers: {}
    feeds: {}
    rules: {}
    inputs: {}
    sequences: {}
    apis: {}
filepath: ""

```
</details>

### Step 5: Inspect the newly exported package

The code of the actions defined in the packages comprising the exported project will be saved into the folders named after
the respective packages. The packages' folders will be created in the same directory into which the manifest file of the
project is exported. Let's examine the current directory into which `my_new_lib1_manifest.yaml` was exported in Step 3 above.

```sh
$ ls -al lib1_package
```

<pre>
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Apr  8 22:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 26 root root 4096 Apr  8 23:38 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  331 Apr  8 22:59 lib1_greeting1.js
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  331 Apr  8 22:58 lib1_greeting2.js
-rw-r--r--  1 root root  331 Apr  8 22:58 lib1_greeting3.js
</pre>
</details>

## Advanced Usage

The dependencies mechanism allows to express a project structure, in which one project uses another project as a library. Also dependencies can be defined for multiple projects. Consider a project `lib2` with the manifest [manifest_lib2.yml](../tests/src/integration/export/manifest_lib2.yaml) and a project `EXT_PROJECT` with the manifest [manifest_ext.yml](../tests/src/integration/export/manifest_ext.yaml). `EXT_PROJECT` (stands for _extending project_) uses actions from both package `lib1_package` (defined in the `lib1` project) and `lib2_package` (defined in the `lib2` project) in order to define rules specific to `EXT_PROJECT`.

`wskdeploy export` will automatically export both `lib1` and `lib2` along with `EXT_PROJECT`. It will not export bindings, because they will be automatically created when re-deploying `lib1`, `lib2`, and `EXT_PROJECT` at another OpenWhisk instance. Each exported project will have a manifest and package folder structure similar to the explained [above](#basic-usage-by-example). The dependency projects will be placed into `dependencies` folder beneath the folder where the manifest of the top project (`EXT_PROJECT` in our example) is placed.

### Exporting a Project with Dependencies

#### Step 1: export `EXT_PROJECT`

```sh
$ ./wskdeploy export --projectname EXT_PROJECT -m ext_test1/ext.yaml
```

#### Step 2: Inspect the resulting directory structure

```sh
$ ls -al ./ext1
```

drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 Apr  9 19:32 dependencies
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 1260 Apr  9 19:32 ext.yaml
</pre>
</details>

#### Step 3 Inspect the dependencies directory

```sh
$ ls -al ./ext1/dependencies
```

drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Apr  9 19:32 ..
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr  9 19:32 lib1_package
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1751 Apr  9 19:32 lib1.yaml
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Apr  9 19:32 lib2_package
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 1751 Apr  9 19:32 lib2.yaml
</pre>
</details>

#### Important Notes

+ Recursive dependencies are not supported.
+ To redeploy a project with dependencies, a user should first deploy dependency projects projects (`lib1` and `lib2` in our example) and only after that, `EXT_PROJECT` can be deployed successfully.
+ `wskdeploy export` does not check for circular dependencies. In case of circular dependencies specified by the user, `wskdeploy`'s behavior is undefined.
+ The manifest name for exporting a top project (`EXT_PROJECT` in our case) should be explicitly specified.
